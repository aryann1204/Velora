## Elevator Pitch
If the US healthcare sector was a country, it would rank 13th in the world for greenhouse gas emissions. Hospitals urgently want to improve their sustainability, but staff are too stretched to tackle inefficiencies. **EcoMed AI** is an intelligent system that allows hospitals to focus on care while leading in sustainability.

## Description
Hospitals use thousands of types of supplies. **EcoMed AI** ingests a hospital supply list and recommends affordable, quality, sustainable alternatives. This analysis is prohibitively time-consuming for hospital staff, who are at capacity running day-to-day operations. Hospitals switching to more sustainable supplies has a multiplier effect of encouraging further investment in this space. Manufacturers have greater incentive to reduce packaging and invest in sustainable materials, such as bioplastics, in order to win business. **EcoMed AI** also helps hospitals reduce the missorting of waste, a major driver of costs and emissions. It is 4x more expensive to dispose of waste via the red hazardous waste stream than the grey general waste stream. Due to risk aversion, healthcare staff commonly put items that are not hazardous into the red waste stream, which is incinerated or chemically treated. Unsure staff can use EcoMed AI to accurately classifies waste into different streams based on WHO standards. **EcoMed AI** can also be used to quickly audit different departments and provide a rating and recommendation on their sorting practices. Improved waste sorting practices have been shown to save hospital systems hundreds of thousands of dollars (Inova Health is one such case study). As a result, **EcoMed AI** is able to save hospitals time and money, while improving sustainability
