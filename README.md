Velora focuses on two concrete problems inside hospitals: supply decisions that create unnecessary waste, and waste-stream mistakes that quietly drain budgets. Both issues are well-documented, both cost real money, and both usually fall through the cracks because no one has time to analyze them.

## What Velora Actually Does

Velora ingests a hospital’s item master or purchasing dataset and cross-references each product with a catalog of lower-impact equivalents. It compares packaging volume, material type, reusability, lifecycle data, and unit cost. When a swap makes sense, Velora shows the clinical match, the price difference, and the reduction in projected waste. This replaces hours of manual spreadsheet comparisons.

For waste handling, Velora runs a classifier trained on WHO disposal standards and real hospital waste logs. Staff can point it at an item or description and get an immediate stream assignment (red bag, general, recycling, sharps, etc.) with an explanation. During audits, Velora aggregates decisions across departments to show where misclassification is happening and how much it’s costing.

## Why Hospitals Use It

Most hospitals overspend on red-bag disposal simply because it’s safer to over-classify than under-classify. Velora gives teams confidence by making the standard clear and consistent. It also highlights which supplies drive the most waste volume and which alternatives have meaningful impact without changing clinical workflow.

## What You Can Measure
- Reduction in red-bag volume.
- Savings from accurate waste sorting.
- Cost impact of supply substitutions.
- Estimated packaging and material reductions.
- Department-level adherence to sorting standards.
